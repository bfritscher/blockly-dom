This is a simple static website that attempts to teach the basics
behind the Document Object Model. It assumes learners are familiar with
basic HTML and CSS, but have no JavaScript or other imperative programming
experience.

Because learning the DOM and JavaScript syntax at the same time can be
overwhelming, the tutorial uses [Blockly][] to guide the learner and help
familiarize them with JS syntax.
